This is an example of a keylogger code.
# How Can I Use It?
To use it you must copy the code, and fill the variables that are mentioned in line 13 of the code. Then, when you run it for first time, it'll create a vbs file in the path that is defined on line 81. This vbs file is all what you need to use the keylogger.
